  abstract     = "Objectives Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), through their
                  ability to generate bone and cartilage tissues, offer
                  potential regenerative therapies for musculoskeletal
                  disorders. However, MSC heterogeneity is a critical challenge
                  to clinical translation. We identified a biomarker (CD317)
                  that discriminates MSC subpopulations with regenerative
                  properties (CD317 neg ) from those with enhanced
                  pro-inflammatory characteristics (CD317 pos ). Here we
                  determined how the secreted output (proteins and
                  extracellular vesicle (EV) cargo) of MSC subtypes determines
                  MSC phenotype. Methods We generated immortalised clonal lines
                  of CD317 neg and CD317 pos human MSCs. EVs were isolated by
                  differential ultracentrifugation and characterised by
                  Transmission Electron Microscopy and Nanoparticle Tracking
                  Analysis. LC-MS/MS was used to quantify EV and total secreted
                  proteins and a NanoString codeset to determine expression of
                  ~800 EV-related miRNAs. Conditioned media containing both
                  secreted proteins and EVs was collected from cells and used
                  in colony-forming assays, which were imaged or lysed for
                  gene-expression analysis. Cell morphometrics were quantified
                  by Phase Focus ptychography and changes in gene expression
                  measured by QPCR. Result Of 861 secreted proteins identified
                  across both MSC subtypes, 44 were significantly increased and
                  129 were significantly decreased in CD317 neg MSCs compared
                  to CD317 pos MSCs (P<0.05). Protein abundance was reversed in
                  the EV compartments of CD317 neg and CD317 pos MSCs with 162
                  and 14 proteins significantly increased respectively
                  (P<0.05). Bioinformatics revealed that both the secretome and
                  EVome of the regenerative CD317 neg MSC were predominantly
                  linked to migration and cell-matrix interactions. We
                  identified 11 differentially expressed miRNAs in the EVs of
                  CD317 neg and CD317 pos MSCs (fold change -2.52-66.25,
                  q<0.001-0.018). Of these, 9 were upregulated in CD317 neg
                  MSCs including miRNAs implicated in promoting osteogenesis
                  (miR-125b-5p, let-7i-5p, miR- 29a-3p, miR-29b-3p and
                  mir-199a-3p/miR-199b-3p) and negative regulation of
                  inflammation (miR- 125b-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-221-3p and
                  miR-21-5p). Growing CD317 pos MSCs in conditioned medium from
                  CD317 neg cells induced a morphological conversion to a CD317
                  neg phenotype, with significantly reduced cell volume and
                  area, increased length:width ratio and migration, and
                  suppressed expression of hallmark proinflammatory genes.
                  Conclusion MSC heterogeneity is reflected in subtype-specific
                  secretomes, which can control MSC function including the
                  interchange of plastic cell states. Appropriate selection of
                  MSC subtypes and/or their secreted products will determine
                  clinical success in regenerative applications.",

              for cell therapy",
  author   = "Phinney, Donald G",
  abstract = "The term mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) was adopted in the 1990s to
              describe a population of bone-marrow-derived cells that
              demonstrated the capacity for tri-lineage differentiation at a
              clonal level. Research conducted during the ensuing decades has
              demonstrated that MSCs fulfill many functions in addition to
              connective tissue progenitors including contributing to the HSC
              niche and regulating the function of immune effector cells of
              both the innate and adaptive immune system. Despite these
              advances, fundamental aspects of MSC biology remain
              indeterminate. For example, the embryonic origin of MSCs and
              their niche in vivo remains a highly debated topic. More
              importantly, the mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and
              lineage specification have also been largely unexplored. The
              later is significant in that MSC population's exhibit
              considerable donor-to-donor and intra-population heterogeneity
              but knowledge regarding how different functional attributes of
              MSCs are specified at the population level is unknown. This poses
              significant obstacles in research and in efforts to develop
              clinical manufacturing protocols that reproducibly generate
              functionally equivalent MSC populations. Herein, I discuss data
              demonstrating that MSC populations are intrinsically
              heterogeneous, elaborate on the molecular basis for this
              heterogeneity, and discuss how heterogeneity impacts clinical
              manufacturing and the therapeutic potency of MSCs.",

              heterogeneity of MSC constitutes an important barrier for
              transferring these capabilities to the clinic. MSC heterogeneity
              depends on their origin (biological niche) or the conditions of

              accepted that many culture conditions of the artificial niche to

               Approach to Multiple Testing",
  author    = "Benjamini, Yoav and Hochberg, Yosef",
  abstract  = "The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for
               controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach,
               though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach
               to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
               rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
               equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
               sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the
               false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
               simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.
               The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the
               criterion are illustrated with examples.",
